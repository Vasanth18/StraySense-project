**Behaviour Analysis of Dogs Using Machine Learning (Stay Sense)**

A final year project focused on analyzing and classifying dog behavior using deep learning techniques. The system utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on video data to detect specific behaviors and provides a web-based interface for user interaction.

**Project Overview**

Stay Sense is a smart surveillance system designed to assist dog owners, trainers, and animal behaviorists in monitoring and understanding dog behavior. By processing video or image input, the system identifies one of five predefined behavior classes:

Aggressive

Fearful

Digging

Resting

Tail Tucking

**Features**

Upload video or image files through a simple web interface.

Receive real-time behavior predictions using a trained CNN model.

Detailed classification output with visual feedback.

Easy-to-use and responsive front-end interface.

Streamlit integration for rapid deployment.

**Technologies Used**

Python

TensorFlow / Keras (CNN model)

OpenCV (video processing)

Streamlit (model deployment & web UI)

HTML & CSS (static front-end pages)

**How to Run the Project**

Clone the repository

Install dependencies

Run the Streamlit app

Upload a video or image through the interface to analyze behavior

**Future Scope**

Integrate drone-based video feed for larger-area monitoring

Expand dataset and add more behavior classes

Deploy as a full-fledged web application with cloud hosting

Introduce real-time alerts or reports based on behavior trends
